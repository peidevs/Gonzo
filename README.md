# Gonzo
Gonzo is a PEI Developers project which is the new version of the Scooter project. Scooter is a door prize picking application. In the past Scooter has been used by the PEI Developers group as a [Code Kata] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)) used to learn new skills.

Gonzo is a rewrite of the application which will focus on being a team project using newer technologies that are of interest to the team. Specs, features and anything else is currently up in the air. See the issues list 

#Scooter 1.0
The original version of Scooter was written in javascript framework Dojo by CodeToJoy. Future Enhancements were later added by swhalley and evanepio.

#Scooter 2.0
The second version of scooter was a port to AngularJS. This version interoduced more features. A configuration menu was introduced which allowed for player configuration and integration with meetup.com to auto populate the attendance at events.

#Why the Rewrite?
Both of the original versions were great, but they were both written in a javascript framework that are getting to be older now. Since the early releases of v1, there has not been great team collaboration or vision on the project. The hope with Gonzo is that the community comes together to build out an exciting new product that will using cutting edge technology. 

The project will be open and we encourage anyone, even outside the PEI Developers group to contribute.
